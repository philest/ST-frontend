Keep up the great work!

Test

There is a spot that you can’t scratch
Right between your shoulder blades,
Like an egg that just won’t hatch
Here you set and there it stay

Turn and squirm andtry to reach it,
Twist your neck and bend your back,

Hear your elbows creak and creak,
Stretch your fingers, now you bet it’s
Going to reach –
	
no that won’t get it-
Hold your breath and stretch and pray,
Only just an inch away,

Worse than a sunbeam you can’t catch	
Is that one spot that
You can’t scratch.
