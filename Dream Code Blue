Branford Asian CS major wear's shirt: "Dive into coding", "Code Blue"

I find out this is a program that Jillian's started? I think she's trying to get more women interested in CS and coding because she now cares about it. 

I'm in a bookstore and find a book with the image of an ocean's surface across it. It looks self-published. It's called "Writing Effective Python" and Jillian published it. Apparently, me and Ken Leidal are listed as editors.. I vaguely remeber photoshopped images of us swimming in the ocean.

The subtitle of the book includes two coding puns. Something like "Avoiding type-mismatch errors and #{insert other pun}"

Jillian's book has less code, and more stories that are somehow related to coding. There's one very personal, touching one but I don't remember it. There's one about a strange sighting.
