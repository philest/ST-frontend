<h1>What does this privacy policy cover?</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how StoryTime collects and uses information from you and other users who access or use the Services, including our treatment of Personal Information. Also, this Privacy Policy covers StoryTime&rsquo;s treatment of any Personal Information that our partners share with us, or that you provide to StoryTime through another third party website or service while using the Services. This policy does not apply to websites, services or practices of companies that we do not own or control, even if they help us operate our Services. Third party providers who do help us operate our Services must adhere to privacy and security obligations in a manner consistent with StoryTime&rsquo;s policies and practices.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what this policy covers: all information that you provide to us and that we collect while you&rsquo;re using StoryTime. This policy doesn&rsquo;t cover third party companies that we don&rsquo;t control but who help us operate our service. Those third party companies must adhere to privacy and security obligations in a manner consistent with StoryTime&rsquo;s policies and practices. Keep reading, there&rsquo;s more about this later!</p>

<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>


<h1>How is children&rsquo;s personal information treated?</h1>

<p>We have included some information below related to the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy and Protection Act (&ldquo;COPPA&rdquo;). COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 (&ldquo;under-13 users&rdquo;). StoryTime relies on a teacher, school, or school district to obtain verifiable parental consent to provide our services to under-13 users. Pursuant to COPPA, we may collect an under-13 user&rsquo;s name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number in order to operate and provide the Services, and we may collect the under-13 user&rsquo;s parent&rsquo;s (or legal guardian&rsquo;s) email address in order to provide notice to the child&rsquo;s parent or guardian that we may contact the under-13 user for the purpose of allowing access to and use of the Services. If StoryTime does not receive the parent&rsquo;s email address within a reasonable time period, the under-13 user will not be able to receive any messages and his/her Personal Information will be deleted. If an under-13 user&rsquo;s StoryTime account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, the account has not received a message through the Services in that period of time), StoryTime&rsquo;s policy is to delete the Personal Information. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from an under-13 user other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn that an under-13 user has provided us Personal Information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible after we have identified it. If you believe that an under-13 user may have provided us Personal Information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at report@joinstorytime.com.</p>

<p>In order for an under-13 user to gain access to additional features or services, StoryTime may employ one or more methods approved by the Federal Trade Commission for verifying parental consent.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>



<p>StoryTime collects limited Personal Information from children under-13, and we rely on a teacher, school or district to obtain the consent of each child&rsquo;s parent when collecting this information. If we do not have an email address of a parent associated with that child&rsquo;s account, we will delete the account. We will also delete the account of any under-13 user that has been inactive for at least a year. Any questions or concerns? Just email us at contact@joinstorytime.com. StoryTime collects limited information from children under-13, and we rely on a teacher, school, or district to get permission from each child's parent when collecting this information. If we don&rsquo;t have a parent's email address associated with their child's account, or if the child&rsquo;s account is inactive after some time, we delete the account. Email us at contact@joinstorytime.com with any questions.</p>

<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>


<h1>What information does StoryTime display or collect?</h1>

<p>When you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels as permitted by the functionality of the Services. StoryTime will not display your personal contact information to other users without your permission. The information we gather from users enables us to verify user identity, allows our users to set up a user account and profile through the Services, and helps us personalize and improve our Services. We retain this information to provide the Services to you and our other users and to provide a useful user experience. When you update your information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time in case you need to need to go back to that version.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>



<p>The information you provide to us by creating an account (or when joining a class or group) is used to deliver our service to you. For example, we use this information to verify your identity and help you create an account on StoryTime. We will not share personal contact information, besides your full name, to other users on StoryTime without your permission.</p>

<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>


<h1>Information you provide to us</h1>

<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Services, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way. With your express consent, you may be able to upload, import or sync contact information from your mobile device (for example, from your address book) to StoryTime. This information may include Personal Information such as your name, phone numbers, email addresses, photographs, and, in certain circumstances, your school and/or district, class, group, club, team or Organization affiliation (which may be used to validate your account or to provide you with notifications via the Services from a teacher, school and/or district, class, group, club, team or affiliated Organization (&ldquo;Notifications&rdquo;), or any other information necessary for us to provide our Services. For under-13 users, we collect a name (first name and last initial), date of birth, district, school, class, email address and/or telephone number, and that under-13 user&rsquo;s parent&rsquo;s email address to provide notice to the parent regarding the Services. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the Personal Information we receive about you to provide you with the Services and also for purposes such as:</p>

<p>authenticating your identity, responding to your requests for certain information, customizing the features that we make available to you, suggesting relevant services or products for you to use, improving the Services and internal operations (including troubleshooting, testing, and analyzing usage), communicating with you about new features and, most importantly, protecting our users and working towards making sure our Services are safer and more secure.</p>

<p>You may modify or remove your Personal Information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your classes, groups, and/or account information. If an Organizer or a verified Organization administrator uploads or adds information about you to your account, you may have to contact and work directly with that Organizer or administrator in order to modify or remove that information.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>



<p>The information you provide to StoryTime is also used to analyze usage and improve our products and services. We don&rsquo;t show or share your personal information without your permission except in the few circumstances described here. We may also review account information to protect the safety of our community.</p>


<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>


<h1>Information collected automatically</h1>

<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you use the Services. StoryTime automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including StoryTime cookie information, the page you requested, and other usage information such as your activity on the Services, the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). None of this information constitutes Personal Information. Certain information that is collected automatically, such as device ID, IP address and phone number, will be treated as Personal Information.</p>

<p>We also may provide to our partners aggregate information derived from automatically collected information about how our users, collectively, use our site. We may share this type of non-personally identifiable, aggregated statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services as well as StoryTime.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>



<p>There is certain information that we gather automatically when you use StoryTime, such as your IP address and cookie information. Some of this information is collected and used in an aggregate and anonymized way to help improve our service. If Personal Information is included, we treat it carefully like all other Personal Information.</p>

<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>


<h1>Mobile application</h1>

<p>When users use our mobile application, we automatically collect the IP address, device ID, device type, and what OS the user is running.</p>

<p>We collect users&rsquo; IP addresses whenever they use our mobile application, which provides us with a coarse approximation of the user&rsquo;s location at the city level in order for StoryTime to, for example:</p>

<p>provide Organizers with a geo-specific long-code (i.e., generic phone number with a local area code), support features such as school selection, and enable other internal measurement and Services features. We also may, with your express consent, request more specific location information in order to provide you with more relevant information (such as nearby classes or relevant groups that you may subscribe to). We will not store or track your device location on an on-going basis or without your permission. We may also collect location-based information from users as part of providing the Services and in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations for the user&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>

<p>While StoryTime collects and temporarily stores phone numbers of first-time users under 13 years of age, we will delete the information collected if parental consent is not obtained. If the underage user has signed up for the Services through SMS and then downloaded StoryTime&rsquo;s mobile application, StoryTime will have and may use the underage user&rsquo;s phone number:</p>

<p>to merge the under-13 user&rsquo;s accounts, to continue SMS delivery services, and/or as a back-up method of notification. </p>


<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>


<p>When you use the StoryTime app, there may be additional information that we collect like your device ID, phone number and approximate location.</p>

<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>


<p>Email and text message communications</p>

<p>If you provide us your email address or phone number, StoryTime may send you administrative messages (such as updates, Notifications, newsletters, and other news) relating to the Services or to respond to communications from you. By maintaining a StoryTime account and/or not opting out of receiving information from StoryTime, you acknowledge and agree that you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile device from other StoryTime users, from StoryTime and/or its agents (as described below) and other individuals or companies if you choose to use services or products that they offer. Receiving these messages may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your computer supports this type of program. Communications of this type are also sent to under-13 users and the parental consent to use this service also covers these messages. If you no longer wish to receive administrative email messages from StoryTime you may opt-out by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each message or by emailing us at contact@joinstorytime.com. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing the legal notices for changes.</p>

<p>To permanently cease receiving SMS text messages, please text @STOPALL:</p>

<p>in reply to any SMS message from that class or group, to a StoryTime long-code (a phone number issued by StoryTime), or in the US, to the StoryTime phone number (203)-202-3505. For more information see this link.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>



<p>We may send you administrative messages regarding StoryTime. You can learn how to unsubscribe from receiving all messages by clicking here.</p>

<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>


<p>Push notifications</p>

<p>We send notices to you when an Organizer of your class or group has posted something new to your class or group, you are sent a message, or when StoryTime needs to inform you of something. If you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may turn them off at the device level. If you are a parent of an under-13 user, you always have the choice to no longer allow your child to receive such communications by contacting us at contact@joinstorytime.com. Any user may email us at contact@joinstorytime.com if such user no longer wishes to receive communications from the Services.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>



<p>There are different notification options. We may send push notifications to your class; you can always opt out of these.</p>

<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>


<h1>What about cookies, pixels and local storage?</h1>

<p>Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many websites, StoryTime uses cookies to discover how people are using our Services and to make them work better.</p>

<p>A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification. As many services do, we (or our agents) may use pixels to learn whether you&rsquo;ve interacted with certain of web or email content on our Services. This helps us measure and improve our Services and personalize your experience on StoryTime.</p>

<p>Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with StoryTime.</p>

<p>StoryTime uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our Services in various ways. These uses generally fall into one of the following categories:</p>

<p>Authentication and security</p>

<p>To log you into StoryTime.</p>

<p>To protect your security.</p>

<p>To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate StoryTime&rsquo;s policies.</p>

<p>For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to StoryTime and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account.</p>

<p>Preferences</p>

<p>To remember information about your browser and your preferences.</p>

<p>For example, cookies may help us remember your preferred language or country that you are in. We can then provide you with StoryTime content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit StoryTime. We can also customize content based on your country, such as disabling SMS, or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws.</p>

<p>Analytics and research</p>

<p>To help us improve and understand how people use our Services.</p>

<p>For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience on StoryTime by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist us with this.</p>

<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Services&rsquo; features without cookies enabled. Note that the use of cookies by anyone other than StoryTime is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over those cookies.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>


<p>Cookies are bits of information that tell us you&rsquo;ve visited StoryTime before and help the browser remember things about you (such as your language setting). Our cookies do not collect any personal information from you. This only applies to StoryTime cookies and no one else&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>


<h1>Mobile analytics</h1>

<p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality and improve the performance of our mobile software on your phone. This software may collect, store and use information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. This software may share information it collects with other third parties as part of providing the analytics services and to comply with applicable laws.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>



<p>When you use the StoryTime app on your phone or tablet, we have analytics that help us understand how you use the app. This helps us improve the features &amp; design!</p>

<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>


<h1>What happens when I associate my account with a school or other organization?</h1>

<p>Users may have the choice of associating their account with a school or other Organization (such as a team or group). This may be required (for example) for teachers and may be either required or strongly encouraged for other types of Organizers in order to use certain features of the Services.</p>

<p>By associating your account with an Organization, you acknowledge and agree that a verified Organization administrator, principal, technology specialist, or other party authorized by the school or organization (such as Organizers associated with the same Organization) may be able to view your User Submissions (including your Personal Information and messaging content but not your personal contact information). In addition, verified Organization administrators and Organizers may be able to make administrative changes to your account, such as, adding, removing, or moving you from classes and/or groups, sending messages on your behalf, and more.</p>

<p>If you are an Organizer affiliated with an Organization, you acknowledge that StoryTime may enable other users who are associated with the same Organization to contact you -- for example, teachers, students, or parents who are associated with your Organization may communicate with you. Participants may also contact each other (in addition to viewing User Submissions). StoryTime does not display in a user&rsquo;s account profile personal contact information of the user to any other users without prior consent.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>



<p>You may be required to link your account with an Organization. Linking helps to verify your identity and may unlock certain features. If your Organization is managed by a verified administrator, they may also have access to certain information in your StoryTime account. We will not display your personal contact information to other users without your permission.</p>


<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;"><div></div></div>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:32px;" id="divider-mobile"><div></div></div>

<h1>Will StoryTime share any of the personal information it receives?</h1>

<p>StoryTime relies on its users to provide accurate Personal Information in order to provide our Services. We try our best to protect that information and make sure that we are responsible in handling, disclosing, and retaining your data. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. If other StoryTime users, other individuals or companies whose products you choose to use, have access to your Personal Information (for example, your messaging content), they may use and share that information in ways that StoryTime cannot, and does not, control. StoryTime shares your Personal Information in personally identifiable form as described below.</p>

<h1>Agents and third party service providers</h1>

<p>Advertising by companies other than StoryTime is not permitted on the Services. However, we employ other companies to perform tasks on our behalf and help us provide certain features of our Services, and may need to share your information with those companies in order to provide our Services to you. Some examples of services for which we use agents include sending email or SMS, analyzing data, and providing user services. These agents may use Personal Information we share with them, for example, to assist us, to provide their services to you and/or us, and to measure and improve the performance of their services. Please see here for further information about the agents we use as part of the Services (including any of their specific terms or policies that are applicable and that may govern use of your information). StoryTime has reviewed the privacy policies and practices of these agents and third party service providers in order to verify that they are capable of complying with StoryTime&rsquo;s policies and practices, including those related to the collection, use, transfer, confidentiality, security and integrity of user data. We will review those agents&rsquo; policies and practices at least annually, but you should review them as well.

<h1>Is information about me secure?</h1>

<p>The security of personal information in the school environment is a top priority for StoryTime.</p>

<p>StoryTime has protections in place to enhance our users' security, and routinely update these protections. We have administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure of or access to personal information. In particular:</p>

<p>Our engineering team is dedicated to keeping your personal information secure.</p>

<p>We work with industry-leading auditors to review and guide our security policies and procedures.</p>

<p>StoryTime stores its data within an AWS region that is FedRAMP compliant.</p>

<p>StoryTime&rsquo;s main database and all backups are encrypted at rest.</p>

<p>The AWS cloud infrastructure has been designed and managed in compliance with regulations, standards, and best-practices, including HIPPA, SOC 1/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 (formerly SAS70), SOC 2, SOC 3, PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, DIACAP and FISMA, ITAR, FIPS 140-2, CSA, and MPAA.</p>

<p>Low-level auditing software is run on all production systems to record potentially malicious actions that may take place.</p>

<p>StoryTime runs periodic penetration tests, then logs and resolves discovered issues.</p>

<p>All StoryTime clients use TLS/SSL when communicating with our servers.</p>

<p>StoryTime endeavors to protect user information and to ensure that user account information is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If StoryTime knows or becomes aware of a security breach of its users&rsquo; personally identifiable information, StoryTime will notify affected users as required by applicable laws and may post a notice on the Services as required by applicable law(s). For additional information about the security measures we use in connection with the Services, please contact us at security@joinstorytime.com.</p>

<p>The Services contain links to other sites or services. StoryTime is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site you should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.</p>

<h3>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h3>



<p>The security of your personal information is extremely important to us and we take measures internally to make sure your information is safe with us. We routinely update our security features and implement new protections for your data. If we learn that your data was breached, we will notify you as soon as possible so you can take actions to protect your data. Learn more about how StoryTime approaches security here.</p>

				<h1>Facebook Messenger Info</h1>

				<p>StoryTime's about getting children's stories to parents to read to their kids. If you're a parent on StoryTime, we ("us", "our", "StoryTime") need to know some information about you (the parent, guardian) so we can get you stories. Here are a few facts:</p>

				<h1>What information we collect</h1>
				<p>We collect information in two ways: directly through you or your child's school, and through your Facebook profile.</p>

				<h3>From you or your child's school:</h3>
				<p>If you are a parent with one of our pilot schools, we may request your name and cell phone number through you or your child’s school. This way, we can contact you via text message or Facebook Messenger and start sending stories. We only collect this data at your consent. Any information granted from schools will be by your permission.</p>
				<h3>From Facebook Messenger</h3>
				<p>
				We use Facebook Messenger to deliver the best experience possible with reading and receiving stories and reading tips. We use Facebook's Graph API to collect information about you to improve your experience with the StoryTime messenger app. This information includes:
				<ol>
					<li>name</li>
					<li>language of preference</li>
					<li>gender</li>
					<li>timezone</li>
				</ol>
				 <p>as indicated on your public Facebook account. This information is only obtained under your direct consent by starting a conversation or accepting a Message Request from our StoryTime messenger bot. </p>
				</p>
				<p>We may gather other data from you through the Messenger app. These are all optional and under your discretion to provide. They include:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>content preferences (favorite stories, characters, etc.)</li>
					<li>hometown</li>
				</ol>
				<p>We also record what messages you've opened and whatever text responses you write to our Bot.</p>

				<h1>How we use this information</h1>
				<p>We mostly use your personal information to customize your experience using the StoryTime bot. For example, we may send you a story referencing your name or hometown. <br>
				We may use your cell phone number to contact you through Facebook Messenger. <br>
				We use information from Facebook's Graph API to ensure that our messages are sent only at the expected time in your timezone and in your preferred language. <br>
				If you're a parent and you signed up for StoryTime through your child's preschool, we'll send messages that you've written to StoryTime to your child's teacher.
