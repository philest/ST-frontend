We may modify this Agreement at any time, but we will do our best to bring this to your attention by posting a notice on the Services or notifying you by email or by some other means. If you don’t agree with the new terms, you may reject them but unfortunately you will no longer be able to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way following notification by StoryTime constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions as modified. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features, impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services at any time. We’ll do our best to provide you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you. </p> <p> You represent and warrant to StoryTime that: </p> <ol> <li> you are at least 18 years old (or, if you are not at least 18 years old, you have your parent’s permission to use the Services, and your parent has read and agrees to this Agreement on your behalf); </li> <li> all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful; </li> <li> you will maintain the accuracy of such information; </li> <li> if you’re agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to this Agreement on the organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to this Agreement (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity). You also certify that you are legally permitted to use and access the Services and take full responsibility for the selection, use of, and access to the Services, including ensuring that you have permission to communicate with anyone you choose to interact with through the Services. </li> </ol> <p> This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions. </p> </section> <section class="terms-privacy--simple-exp column---1-3 column---desktop-1"> <h5>What this is saying</h5> <p> We work hard to improve the StoryTime experience for you, so our terms may change from time to time. We will update you when we make significant changes.

Please read our Privacy Policy, located at <a href="/privacy">JoinStoryTime.com/privacy</a>. </p> </section> <section class="terms-privacy--simple-exp column---1-3 column---desktop-1"> <h5>What this is saying</h5> <p> Another important document to look at is our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which outlines what personal information StoryTime collects from you and how we use that information to provide our service. </p> </section> </div> <hr> <div class="columns columns---loose"> <section class="column---2-3 column---desktop-1 row---desktop"> <h2>Use by children</h2> <p> The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers notify parents and obtain their consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. <strong> StoryTime only collects personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student’s school, district and/or teacher has agreed, via the terms described below, to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose that personal information to StoryTime. </strong> Except as expressly set forth below, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13. </p> <ul> <li> <p> For children under 13 we may collect a child’s name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address or telephone number, and the child’s parent’s email address in order to notify the parent that we may contact the child for the purpose of providing the Services for which the child’s teacher, Organizer (as described below) or school administrator has signed up to use. Note that if the StoryTime account of a child under 13 is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, that account has not received a message through the StoryTime Services in that time), StoryTime’s policy is to delete the personally-identifiable information associated with that child’s account. While we delete the account in these situations, some of the child’s data may persist in the files of StoryTime’s agents or service providers for some period of time until it is removed from their systems as well. </p> </li> <li> <p> We may collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 but only in support of the learning environment. For StoryTime to collect this type of personal information, a student’s school, district or teacher must agree to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services. The student’s school, district or teacher may disclose that personal information to us for a legitimate educational interest. </p> <ul> <li> <p> If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning you must obtain consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you are authorized by your school or district to use the Services. You also represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school or district. For more information on COPPA, please <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">click here</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p> If you are a school, district, or teacher providing consent on behalf of parents or guardians, you may be required to provide adequate school credentials and a valid school email address to verify your identity. </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@JoinStoryTime.com">contact@JoinStoryTime.com</a>. </p> </section> <section class="terms-privacy--simple-exp column---1-3 column---desktop-1"> <h5>What this is saying</h5> <p> StoryTime cares about children’s privacy, and complies with COPPA, a law created to protect the privacy of minors. We collect limited information for under-13 users and only if we have parental consent. If we don’t have consent from a parent or guardian, we delete the information. If you are a teacher or a school providing consent on behalf of parents, you are also responsible for complying with COPPA.

StoryTime reserves the right to charge fees for certain features. We will notify you when we intend to charge for a service or feature. You will always have the choice whether to use those features. If you continue to use any service or feature after you have been notified of any applicable fees, that use constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased fees. </p> <p> Through StoryTime, you may be able to access and use products or services operated by other individuals or companies who are not employed or controlled by StoryTime (such as, a payment platform to request and/or make payments). If you use any of these products or services, you must review and agree to the additional terms and conditions and privacy policy, as well as pay any applicable fees required to use those products. Any information you agree to provide will be governed by that business’ privacy policy. </p> <p> Note that, by using the Services, you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile device, which may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply to your use of the Services. </p> </section> <section class="terms-privacy--simple-exp column---1-3 column---desktop-1"> <h5>What this is saying</h5> <p> StoryTime is free right now, and we have no plans to charge users for the basic service. In order to keep the lights on, we will charge fees for certain features. You may choose to use and pay for additional products and services that we or our partners offer. We’ll make it clear when fees are added to StoryTime. We promise :) </p> </section> </div> <hr> <div class="columns columns---loose"> <section class="column---2-3 column---desktop-1 row---desktop"> <h2>Additional terms</h2> <p> This Agreement applies to all users of our Services, but there are special terms for you depending on what type of user you are. If you are, for example, a teacher, coach or parent who creates a “class” or “group” of members, then you are an <b>Organizer</b>. If you are, for example, a student, teammate or parent who is invited to be or added as a member of a class or group by an Organizer, you are a <b>Participant</b>. If you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization, such as a school or school district, club, or team, you are an <b>Organization</b>. You may not sign up for or use the Services as someone you are not; StoryTime may disable or terminate your account if you do so. Please read on below to find out what additional terms apply to you. </p> <ul> <li> <p> If you are a <b>Participant</b> (such as a student, parent, or other individual invited to join a class or group by an Organizer): </p> <ul> <li> <p> You must get your parent or guardian to read and agree to this Agreement before using the Services if you are under 18. </p> </li> <li> <p> You will only join schools, classes and/or groups to which you have been invited, or to which you belong. </p> </li> <li> <p> In certain cases, you may be invited to join a class or group by another Participant who is already a member of that class or group. </p> </li> <li> <p> The Organizer and other Participants of your class or group may be able to view information (including your personally identifiable information but not personal contact information), as well as your User Submissions (defined below). </p> </li> <li> <p> Verified administrators of the Organization that your class or group is affiliated with as well as the Organizers of your class or group may be able to add, remove, and/or move you from classes or groups within the same Organization. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> If you are accessing the Services as an <b>Organizer</b> (such as a teacher, administrator, parent or other individual creating a class or group) and inviting users to join as Participants: </p> <ul> <li> <p> The Services may allow you to invite users to join and/or to add users to your class(s) and/or group(s). </p> </li> <li> <p> You can invite Participants and other Organizers to your class or group by distributing “class codes” or “group codes”, and communicate with those users, (in some cases, there may be more than one Organizer per class/group). </p> </li> <li> <p> You may only share class or group codes with Participants and Organizers whom you wish to subscribe to your class/group. If you plan to broadly or publicly publish these codes, you must manage the accuracy of your subscriber lists carefully. </p> </li> <li> <p> It’s your responsibility to maintain and monitor the accuracy of list of Participants for each of your classes or groups. </p> </li> <li> <p> If you are verified by an administrator of your Organization, you may be able to access information and User Submissions (defined below) (including personally identifiable information but not personal contact information) of Participants and other Organizers in your class, group or affiliated Organization. You also may add, remove, and move Participants and modify Participant lists. </p> </li> <li> <p> You understand that if you are verified by an Organization administrator of your Organization, the Organization administrators may be able to join or message members of your class or group, add or update information in your StoryTime account profile, add, move or remove you from classes or groups affiliated with the Organization, and/or take other actions relating to your access and use of the Services through the Organization. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> If you are an <b>Organization</b> (such as a school, school district or club): </p> <ul> <li> <p> You must maintain the accuracy of the information relating to your Organization. By way of example, you will only permit staff members (such as teachers) who are current employees of your organization to use the Services and to create their own class or group codes. Upon termination of a staff member’s employment with the Organization, you will require such individual to delete and cease using all class or group codes he or she has in his or her possession. If at any time you learn that a user of the Services claims to be affiliated with your organization but is not, in fact, affiliated with your Organization, or of any other inaccuracy relating to your Organization’s information, you will notify StoryTime immediately by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@JoinStoryTime.com">contact@JoinStoryTime.com</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p> If StoryTime verifies you as an administrator of your Organization, you may have the ability to perform the following tasks: </p> <ol> <li> invite and add Organizers and Participants to the Services, </li> <li> add, move, or remove Organizers and Participants from classes and/or groups affiliated with your Organization, and </li> <li> connect and upload or sync information relating to Organizers, Participants, classes and/or groups using a data upload or syncing mechanism (such as, using CSV upload or through integration with your School Information Systems (SIS)). </li> </ol> <p> IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO ANY OF THE ABOVE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE ALL RIGHTS AND HAVE OBTAINED ALL CONSENTS AND AUTHORIZATIONS NECESSARY TO PERFORM SUCH TASKS. StoryTime may use the information you upload to the Services in order to verify Organizers’ and Participants’ affiliations and otherwise to help us provide you with the Services. </p> </li> <li> <p> As a verified administrator of your Organization, you may be able to view and manage users and information affiliated with your Organization. For example, you may be able to join classes and groups created by Organizers affiliated with your Organization, communicate directly with other users affiliated with your Organization, add, remove, or move users from classes and/or groups affiliated with your Organization, and access and manage information and User Submissions (defined below) (including personally identifiable information but not personal contact information) of and relating to Organizers, Participants, and other members within your Organization. </p> </li> <li> <p> With respect to all users of StoryTime (whether you are a Participant, Organizer or Organization): </p> <p> IF YOU INVITE OR ADD ANYONE TO USE StoryTime AND/OR USE ANY FEATURE OF THE SERVICES WHICH REQUIRES SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF ANYONE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IF YOU IMPORT CONTACTS FROM YOUR ADDRESS BOOK TO THE SERVICES), YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE OBTAINED CONSENT FROM EACH PERSON TO: </p> <ul> <li> RECEIVE SUCH INVITATION AND BE ADDED TO THE SERVICES; </li> <li> <p> RECEIVE MESSAGES FROM </p> <ol> <li> StoryTime, </li> <li> OTHER PARTICIPANTS OF THE CLASS OR GROUP, AND </li> <li> OTHERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR CLASS OR GROUP (SUCH AS, ORGANIZERS AND VERIFIED ORGANIZATION ADMINISTRATORS); </li> </ol> <p> AND </p> </li> <li> PROVIDE THAT PERSON’S PERSONAL INFORMATION TO StoryTime. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </section> <section class="terms-privacy--simple-exp column---1-3 column---desktop-1"> <h5>What this is saying</h5> <p> You have different rights and responsibilities depending on what type of user you are - Organizer, Participant or Organization.

When an Organizer adds a new Participant to a class or group, that Participant will receive a welcome message, instructions on how to stop receiving messages, and information on how to avoid certain charges by downloading the StoryTime application. StoryTime may inform Participants who have not replied that they will automatically be removed from the class or group. StoryTime may also send other administrative messages.
